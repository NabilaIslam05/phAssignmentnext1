How TypeScript Improves Code Quality and Maintainability

TypeScript builds on top of JavaScript by adding static types, which means it can catch mistakes while you're writing code — not after it's already running. This helps you avoid bugs and keeps your code more reliable.

How it helps:

TypeScript spots common errors before our code runs, saving time and frustration.

It adds types makes our code more readable, like built-in documentation.

We get better autocomplete, hints, and real-time feedback in your editor.

We can refactor or update code with confidence because TypeScript helps track what needs to change.

It keeps our code organized and consistent as your project grows.

Clear types make it easier for everyone on the team to understand and work with the code.

We don’t have to rewrite everythin, we can gradually introduce TypeScript into existing projects.






What Is Type Inference in TypeScript and Why It Matters

Type inference means TypeScript can automatically guess the types of things like variables, function arguments, and return values, so you don’t always have to write them out yourself.

Why It matters:

Takes less time to write code,You don’t need to declare types everywhere.

This keeps our code readable and clean.

This gives us Built-in safety ,We get type checks, autocomplete, and error warnings.

This is very easier to adapt. easily moves from JavaScript to TypeScript.
